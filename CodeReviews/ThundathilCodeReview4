Comments:
I like the use of inverted boolean to make the pipe face up or down. In the init method, there should have been a better way of adding the hidden level than hard coding it into the init method.
Approximate Number of minutes taken to complete the review: < 3 mins
Hypothetical Change: 
How about adding an enum with four facing directions so that the pipe can be facing multiple directions? That might make it better
