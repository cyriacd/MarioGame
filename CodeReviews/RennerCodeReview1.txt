Sprint 1
MarioActionState.cs
Author: John Simerlink

Code is organized and small and simple, but the logic behind the code does not really make sense. If MarioActionState is holding a variable called "actionState" it might make more sense for 
when the specific action states are initialized that they set that variable to whatever it is.

Also, begin calls the begin class which just switches state and also calls a method called "end" which all seems unnecessary and invalid. Confusing why it is doing this.

Time to complete: 20 minutes.
