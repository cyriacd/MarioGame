I know this file was heavily refactored to have very simple and readable code,
but with the addition of diffrent block states, the file seems to be more clustered
now. There are about 34 lines of nested ifs andloops just for the blocks.
And many of the checks seems to be sort of redundant (I havent looked deep into 
this file). 
Number of minutes taken to complete the review 20mins
One good change would be to move the move the code for the block creation into 
a different method and then refactor the block checks in that method. To make this work easier, I also think changing the format of blocks in the json file woul
be helpful
