The code in Update(gameTime) method needs to be refactored. When checking for collision 
and iterating through each of the elements, There are too many nested ifs and loops
Instead of doing all of the checking (post collision condition checking) in the Update Method,
it might be wiser to delegate each of the entity to do its own post collision condition checking
This will make the entities deal with their own collisions
Number of minutes taken to complete the review
There would have to be handleCollision(TypeOfCollision) for the entities that would then actually 
change their states or not, depending on the conditions
