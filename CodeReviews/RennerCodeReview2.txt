Almost every line has a variable being casted to something to call a function defined in the casted class. It seems that a more specific implementation of a class
is needed for this class. Also, everything in update involves an if statement, and it seems as though it is unclear what it is changing initially.
Maybe this could all be put into functions within Mario. While we are talking about Mario, it might make a lot more sense just to put more things in update itself.
Perhaps call command listeners that are checked on every iteration to see if any commands had been called in Mario. If something is called update, it might
make most sense just to have everything that updates Mario go through that. Although ChangeActionState and ChangePowerUpState are trying to inherit its
base class methods, it actually does not override, which is kind of a misimplementation of object oriented practices. Although it does call base.Change...
so that is nice. Hopefully more of this code can be implemented in the base classes, such as "SetBoundingBox" which sounds like something that would be
applicable to all entities. I like that everything that is applicable to Mario is central to Mario.cs class, though.
