Why do we still have a SpriteTypes enum? That was useful for sprint0 but we now have different sprite classes (Sprite, AnimatedSprite) etc . . . and having that enum is no longer necessary. We likewise no longer have the need for the SwitchToAnimatedStillCommand and SwitchToAnimatedMovingCommand etc. commands.

When should our private variables start with an underscore and when should they not? _script and Sprites are both private but have different capital conventions.

In LoadContent, I don't like that we have to have knowledge of the properties inside of _script. Why do we have to manually add _script.mario.mSprite, _script._blocks[], etc. . . Couldn't we make a way to add all the sprites for all the entities in _script? Perhaps this is more a design flaw of _script. Currently the way it is everytime we add a new object to the scene there are two points of change we have to think about: calling _script.Add{EntityType}() in Initialize() and Sprites.Add() for each instance's sprite of each entity we have. Again, we also have coupling and lack of cohesion between script and scene. IMO, _script shouldn't have knowledge of or have to use _script._blocks, _script.items etc.

Perhaps use lambda expressions instead of foreach loops.

Again ChangeSprite() was useful for Sprint0 but not Sprint1.
